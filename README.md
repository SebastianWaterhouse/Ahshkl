Pythonic procedurally-generated object-based text-based choose your own adventure.

Beginning
=========
Ahshkl began on November 11th, 2014, when I, Sebastian W. felt that I wanted a game where I could kill a monster by pouring a cement bucket down the monster's mouth.

About

As mentioned above, I wanted to give the player the possibility to solve issues with new and inventive ways.

Source Code Jargon
==================
Bopa: Body Part(s)
Tege: Terrain Generation
Obje: Object(s)

Disu: Direct Subclasses

=======================
CAUTION: SUBJECT TO EXTREME CHANGE

Add more bopas and objes! May even also throw to the hordes my debug test environment instead of just making essentially an API.
