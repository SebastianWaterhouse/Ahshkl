Ahshkl
======

Pythonic procedurally-generated object-based text-based adventure game. (Want any more adjectives?)

About
=====
I started this project when I wanted to kill a monster in a video game by pouring cement in it's mouth. I then evolved the idea to be able to do anything. Not "Anything" minecraft-style, but actually anything.

Source Code Jargon
==================
Bopa: Body Part(s)
Tege: Terrain Generation
Obje: Object(s)
Orcl: Original Class
Disu: Direct Subclasses
T2, 3, etc.: Tier 2, 3, etc.
