Pythonic procedurally-generated object-based text-based adventure game.

About
=====
I started this project when I wanted to kill a monster in a video game by pouring cement in it's mouth.

The game is created by basic shapes called body parts combining to make more complex shapes, and so on, to make functional objects that are used in creatures/props which are used in creating scenes which progress Zork-like.

NEWS
====
Github badges are cool! Also I am now using travis-ci.
