Ahshkl
======

Pythonic procedurally-generated object-based text-based choose your own adventure.

Beginning
=========
Ahshkl began on November 11th, 2014, when I, Sebastian W. felt that I wanted a game where I could kill a monster by pouring a cement bucket on it's face. That day I figured out how I was going to do this, and on November 12, 2014 I began coding Ahshkl.

About
=====
As mentioned above, I wanted to give the player the possibility to solve issues with new and inventive ways.
